## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Create a custom `UITableViewCell`.
* Use this `UITableViewCell` by populating it with necessary info.

* Can iterate over an Array calling enumerate().
* Work with the following methods on arrays:
	* append()
	* insert(_:atIndex:)
	* removeAtIndex()
	* subscript syntax with arrays
	* count
	* isEmpty
* Can work with dictionaries 
* Can iterate over a dictionary
* Knows how to work with optionals
* Classes
* Structs
* Properties

## Outline / Notes

* I've included a completed Xcode project which includes a custom made cell.
* Include screenshots and be explicit along every step of the way in explaining how to create a custom `UITableViewCell`. 
* I didn't want selecting the cell to segue anywhere because I want for one of the labs coming up for them to produce something like this, where they will be creating a class that represents something and then it will be their job to pass this along to the destination VC in the prepareForSegue method and present it in some form on the next screen.
